### What I learned

In the course of developing this project, I had the opportunity to explore Next.js for the first time, and it was a truly enjoyable experience. Next.js provided powerful tools for server-side rendering, routing, and optimizing performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications. This project allowed me to delve into the world of server-rendered React applications and deepen my understanding of Next.js's capabilities.
This project also provided an opportunity to practice problem-solving and debugging in a real-world context. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that enhanced my skills as a web developer. I look forward to incorporating Next.js into future projects and continuing to expand my skills as a developer.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to continue refining and optimizing the codebase of this project. I aim to enhance code modularity, improve code organization, and implement best practices to make the codebase cleaner and more maintainable. Additionally, I intend to explore performance optimizations and conduct further testing to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Useful resources
